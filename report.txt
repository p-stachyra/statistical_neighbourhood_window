  #    #    #  
  #    ?    #  
  #    #    #  
[***] The question mark must be replaced with a mean value for other cells.
[***] Although, other cells may contain missing value and may not be included in the computation.
[***] Therefore, a variadic function was used to account for the variability of the number of arguments.

[ # ] The mean value to replace the missing value: 7.375000
